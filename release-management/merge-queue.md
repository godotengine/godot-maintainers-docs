# PRs merge queue

Guidelines for release coordinators to use the PRs merge queue project to track, review, and merge PRs during development phases.

- Target users: **Release coordinators**, and to some extent **team leaders / area maintainers**.
- Relevant reading for: **All engine contributors**, to understand how merges are scheduled.
- Other relevant docs: [PR review process](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/workflow/pr_review_guidelines.html).
  * Note: This page currently says that either team leaders or production team members (here "release coordinators") can merge PRs. This is slightly outdated and the current process has only release coordinators doing merges (with exceptions for e.g. critical CI or build fixes).

## Rationale

Godot's development currently requires that PRs are first approved by maintainers, and then merged by release coordinators. This is for multiple reasons:

- Release coordinators are in charge of making engine builds (dev snapshots, beta, RC, stable), and need to control the timing of merges in the `master` branch, to ensure the snapshots they build are suitable for end user testing.
- The PR review process has a number of requirements for both technical assessment by competent maintainers, and stylistic or organization considerations. Release coordinators are trained to assess whenever all relevant reviews have been done, and can sign off on merging the PR.
- Godot's CI process is heavy, and to avoid wasting resources and CI congestion, PRs are merged in batches. This is currently a manual process done by release coordinators.
- Adding some delay between a "ready to merge" maintainer approval and the actual merge gives time to other maintainers to voice concerns they may have.

## Process

The internal process for merging a PR is:

- A PR is opened, `CODEOWNERS` assigns relevant reviewers, and reviews are done. An unreviewed PR should *not* be added to the merge queue project.
  * An exception to this is if the PR is a must-have for the next dev snapshot (e.g. regression fix, or very important to merge timely to fit the roadmap for that release), in which case it can be added to the merge queue even before approval.
  * TODO: Should we add a "Priority review" state for this?
- At least one engine maintainer approves the PR, i.e. it becomes an "approved PR". This is the cue to add the PR to the merge queue project, to hand it over to release coordinators.
- Release coordinators ensure that all approved PRs get tracked in the merge queue project. See below for how to do this.
- Approved (or priority) PRs can have the following statuses in the merge queue project:
  * To Review: Despite having one approval, more approvals are still needed for it to be ready. This should be reflected in the review requests, and clarified to other release coordinators with the comment field.
  * Needs Work or Consensus: These PRs have been approved at least by one maintainer, but more work is needed, or a consensus still needs to be formed. The reason for being shelved here needs to be written in the comment field.
  * Approved: These PRs are approved and a priori ready to merge. Release coordinators do a second review and write in the comment field whether it's indeed ready to merge (with their name), or still needs some action (e.g. rebase or squashing). During that second review, PRs can be sent back to "To Review" (if more maintainers need to approve) or "Needs Work or Consensus".
  * TODO: The state of "approved by maintainers AND approved for merge by release coordinators" could warrant its own status instead of relying on a comment. But we still need to know *who* approved for merge.
- At least once per day, release coordinators do a merge batch with all the approved PRs queued for the "Next Wave" and where a release coordinator has confirmed that they're ready to go.

## Keeping track of all approved PRs

As a goal, all PRs which have been approved by a maintainer should be tracked in the merge queue project, and be assessed by release coordinators in a timely manner.

This implies:

- Making sure that PRs that get approved by maintainers get added to the merge queue project. Approved PRs that haven't yet been added to the merge queue can be found with this search: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+review%3Aapproved+-project%3Agodotengine%2F90
  * Release coordinators should make it a habit of reviewing this list daily to find newly approved PRs.
  * TODO: The above list is specific to 4.4 (project "90") but can be adjusted if/when we switch to a new project for future releases. It also doesn't discriminate on milestone, as we're interested in PRs that may have `4.4`, `4.x`, or no milestone. Future GitHub changes should allow making complex queries with `OR` but this isn't possible yet.
- Assessing PRs added to the merge queue by other maintainers, which may not have been seen yet by release management. Currently, a lot can be found in the "Mislabeled" tab as some maintainers don't set the wave or status when adding to the merge queue. Likewise, some maintainers add unapproved PRs to the merge queue (typically their own, which they want reviewed), and that's a misuse of the project that we need to clarify.
- Reviewing PRs ourselves as part of our daily routine, and adding them right away to the merge queue project with the right wave and status.
- (Re)-Assessing the items in all statuses in the "Next Wave" tab regularly, to ensure that we don't miss when a PR that was close to ready is now fully ready. PRs that were put in "To Review" or "Needs Work or Consensus" which get a new maintainer review should automatically be moved to "Approved", which helps put them back in the "hot" queue.

## Merging a PR batch

One purpose of the merge queue, aside from doing all the review validations described above, is to be able to merge batches of multiple PRs all at once. This helps reduce the strain on CI resources by starting only one CI workflow for a whole batch being merged.

The process to make a PR batch is along those lines:

- Go through the "Approved" PRs with a "Ready to merge" comment from a release coordinator, and open them all in tabs. Keep those tabs open through the process.
- Make sure that those PRs are actually ready to merge (there might have been new comments/reviews made after a release coordinator approval, or new merge conflicts, etc.).
- Make sure that each PR has the proper milestone (e.g. `4.4` if merged during the 4.4 release cycle), properly references the issues it closes with a closing keyword, and that those issues also have the corresponding milestone.
- Copy the PR numbers of all PRs meant for a merge batch in some file, one per line.
- Merge them all locally with `git merge --no-ff` and a merge commit message matching what GitHub would generate (see the script below).
  **DO NOT REBASE** after this, as it would flatten the merge commits and lose the association to the original PRs.
- Build once and run the editor to make sure no obvious bug is being introduced.
- Push to the `master` branch.
- Go through the now merged open tabs for each PR and thank the contributor(s) for their work.

Here's a script that can be used (at least on Linux) to merge a PR locally in the same way that GitHub would do it. It depends on the [`gh` command line tool](https://cli.github.com/).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

PR=$1
VIEW=$(gh pr view $PR)
AUTHOR=$(echo "$VIEW" | grep -m 1 "author:" | sed "s/^author:[[:space:]]*//")
TITLE=$(echo "$VIEW" | grep -m 1 "title:" | sed "s/^title:[[:space:]]*//")

BASE_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

gh pr checkout $PR -f

PR_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
MESSAGE_TAG="$AUTHOR/$PR_BRANCH"
if [ "$PR_BRANCH" == "$AUTHOR/$BASE_BRANCH" ]; then # master
  MESSAGE_TAG="$PR_BRANCH"
fi

MESSAGE="Merge pull request #$PR from $MESSAGE_TAG

$TITLE"
echo -e "Merging PR with message:\n$MESSAGE"

git checkout $BASE_BRANCH

git merge --no-ff $PR_BRANCH -m "$MESSAGE"
git branch -d $PR_BRANCH
```

With the above script saved as `~/.local/bin/git-local-merge` (assuming this is in your `PATH`), and a list of PR numbers to merge saved in `~/prs-to-merge`, prepare a batch with:

```bash
for pr in $(cat ~/prs-to-merge); do git-local-merge $pr; done
```

## Future work

The above procedure is based on the current workflow with the merge queue project, and the various usage that different maintainers make of it.

It's meant to clarify for release coordinators how they should use it, and in that process we should keep re-evaluating how to improve both the merge queue project and the guidelines further, so that things are clearer for both maintainers and new release coordinators.
