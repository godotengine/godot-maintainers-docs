# Introduction to Triage

So you are looking to help with bug triage? First of all, thank you! Your help means a lot!

Bug triage is a fundamental part of our development, this should not be surprising,
but this process is far more than just confirming that a bug is happening. The more information
we have on a bug, what problems it causes, when it was introduced, what areas it affects, and
so on makes a lot of difference. A bug being thoroughly triaged bug helps other contributors a lot.
Knowing something was an intentional change means not wasting time trying to "fix" it,
knowing all the details means solving the complete issue and not just part of it,
and it minimizes the risk of introducing new bugs due to not having the complete picture.

## Tasks

Listed below are basic instructions and descriptions of different triage tasks.
When relevant these sections link to more detailed documentation on these tasks.
For more detailed instructions on the triage process in general, please see [Bug Triage Overview](/bug-triage/triage-workflow.md).

### Confirming report details

The most basic step of triage is to make sure an issue report is filled in properly.
For details on what a report should contain please see [triage workflow](/bug-triage/triage-workflow.md).

### Identifying duplicates

Duplicate reports add a lot of clutter to the tracker, and critical details reported on one report
might not be present on others. Identifying duplicate issues is very helpful to ensure everything
is tracked in one place. This can be difficult due to different wording, but using tags can help narrow
things down, make sure to also look at the pinned issues at the top of the issue page in case the author
missed these.

Another tool that can help identifying duplicates are the team trackers, for a list of these see
[Team Triage Trackers](/bug-triage/team-trackers.md).

### Testing bugs

Testing bugs is a critical part of bug triage. Even just confirming that a bug occurs
is useful. Any information here is helpful, not being able to reproduce a bug with the
provided steps or MRP adds information about what might be going on.

If you're unable to reproduce the bug it could mean that the steps are incomplete,
or that the MRP is incorrect. In this case you might need to ask the author for further
details or ask them to create an MRP.

### Creating MRPs

If you are able to reproduce a bug, but there is no attached MRP, you can help by creating one.
This is especially important if the steps are more complex, or if the issue requires specific content,
like a 3D model or a texture. Having an MRP is very useful for the process of solving issues and testing
solutions, and not having to create the conditions again streamlines this process.

### Bisecting regressions

Figuring out when a particular bug occurred can greatly help fixing the issue, or at least pointing to what might
have caused it. Knowing when a bug occurred also helps with deciding if a fix for a bug should be cherry-picked to
a previous version. When a bug is reproducible in a current release but not in a previous one (i.e. a feature broke),
we call it a regression.

Bisecting can be done at multiple levels, the basic level is checking if, for example, a bug that was
confirmed on `4.4` is also reproducible on `4.3`. Next you can test development releases, such as `4.4.beta1`,
these can be found in the [Godot archive](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/).
Once the specific development release has been identified you can go one step further and
[bisect](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/workflow/bisecting_regressions.html) the regression.

Make sure to announce the fact that you are bisecting a bug on the issue report to make sure no one else starts
bisecting it as well, as bisecting can take some time.

### Testing confirmed bugs with other environments

Some bugs may have platform-specific components which may or may not be apparent in the initial report.
Notably issues that relate to areas like rendering, windowing, input, audio, file I/O,
or buildsystem - or outright crash reports - can often be platform specific.
If you have a different setup from the bug reporter (operating system, GPU, etc.) and the issue can
reasonably be expected to involve platform-specific components, it can be very useful to test the bug
with your setup. Testing the bug and reporting if you can reproduce it, or if you can't,
adds important information that can help identifying the cause of the bug, and making sure that contributors
know how to reproduce it. This applies especially if someone reports that they can't reproduce the bug
on Windows but you are able to do so on macOS for example.

Here extra details like your graphics driver version, different hardware like a specific sound card or similar can also be relevant.

### Bringing bugs to the attention of maintainers

In cases where a report might have gone unnoticed by maintainers, for example when a report has been confirmed but nothing
has happened for a long time (and you can reproduce it too), linking the issue in the team's RC channel can help bringing attention to the issue.

For a list of these see [Team Triage Trackers](/bug-triage/triage-workflow.md#team-triage-trackers), as well as mentioning it in the
[#bugsquad](https://chat.godotengine.org/channel/bugsquad) channel if it needs more attention by triagers. For editor related bugs
you can mention it in the [#editor](https://chat.godotengine.org/channel/editor) channel.

<!-- TODO: Further details on when it might be relevant to mention, instructions to ping individual maintainers? -->
